# Chapter 8: Subnets and VLANs

## Network Segmentation

Separating traffic on one network into its own broadcast domain

* enahnces security
* improves performance
* simplifies troubleshooting

Networks are often segmented by geographic location, departmental boundaries, and device types

## Subnets

One way to segment a network is to add a router at certain points (ie one on each floor)

Subnetting: dividing pool of IP addresses into groups for each LAN

Subnet mask: used to determine what subnet a device belongs to
Always 1s and 0s, 1s mark the network portion of the IP address, 0s mark the host portion
