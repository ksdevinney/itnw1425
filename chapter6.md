## Characteristics of Wireless Transmissions

Wireless signals are carried through the air by electromagnetic waves

Wireless spectrum: airwaves, frequency range of electromagnetic waves used for data and voice, spans frequency bands between 9 kHz and 300 GHz

Band used by a wireless device is defined by its frequency range; bands are subdivided into channels and channels are subdivided into narrowband channels so devices can share the same band

FHSS: short bursts of data are transmitted on a single frequency, next burst goes to next frequency in the sequence; cheaper and performs better in crowded, indoor environments
DSSS: data streams are divided into "chips" and spread over all available frequencies at the same time, uses bandwidth more efficiently and has a higher throughput

DSSS users: Wi-Fi, ZigBee
FHSS users: Bluetooth

Different technologies have ways of handling collisions
