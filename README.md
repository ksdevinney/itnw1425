# ITNW 1425: Fundamentals of Networking Technology

This repo contains notes from a class I took on networking technology through Dallas College during summer 2022. This class sovered the basics of networks, including the seven-layer OSI model, cabling standards, network security and risks, and various network protocols. 

Each file here contains my notes, chapter by chapter. A lot of this material was very challenging for me! I was unfamiliar with the technical side of networks and how they function, so it was interesting to think about things from that angle.
