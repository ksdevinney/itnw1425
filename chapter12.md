# Chapter 12: Wide Area Networks

## WAN Essentials

WAN travels a significant distance, connects LANs

WANs:
* use networking devices to connect networks over a wide geographical area
* usually owned by service providers

WAN sites: geographic endpoints connected by a WAN
DTE: customer's endpoint device on a WAN
DCE: carrier's endpoint device
DTE communicates on the LAN, DCE communicates on the WAN

Types of WAN links:
* dedicated line: continuously available communication path not available to others
* virtual circuit: appears to be a dedicated line, but can be any configuration

Switching: how connections are created between nodes on a network
* circuit switched: connection is established before nodes begin transmitting data
* packet switched: data is broken into packets, packets travel any path to destination, reassembled by node

packet-switched is more common

CPE: equipment located on customer premises
